will need a daemon to go through each propcott and update the values. we will auto-scale the throughput during quiet times to allow for this to run quicker.

in-memory layer holds supporters while they wait to be persisted.
in-memory layer writes to disk every 5s.

homepage/explore propcotts are fetched hourly (by sync, not interval)

each explore list holds 1,048,575 propcotts (20 bit int max)
new,today,week,month,alltime = 5,242,875 propcotts
5,242,875 * 20b = 104,857,500b = ~12.5MB
first x held in Buffer while full lists written to disk
need integer value for length of each list

each propcott preview needs:
attr		type	length	max bytes 	expected
title 		text	255		765
what 		text	255		765
target 		text	100		300
media_link	text	510		1,530
media_type
supporters	num 	-		8
total						<3kb		1kb

10 in Buffer (1 page) (50 total)
50 kb (150kb max)

1,000 on disk (100 pages) (500 total)
~5MB (~15MB max)

these lists should be held in S3 and SNS should be sent out whenever they are updated. They should be kept in a single file.




CSRF middleware
app.get('/form', [csrf, ...]);

Maintenance middleware
app.use(maintenance);

Authenticate middleware (wait, we need acl)
app.use(authenticate('guest'));
app.use(authenticate.can('read')); // can this know scope of object?
