# Propcott

## Testing

I've opened up my development computer to access from the public so that you can view the software in development before we get a server. It will only be accessible during times I have it on and the server running, but I imaging there will be times you'll want to see it or I'll want to show you something where we can't meet in person. It will ask for a username and password. The username is `propcott` and password is the same as the one you told me. If the link below doesn't work, I don't have the server running at the moment.
