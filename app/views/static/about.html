	<h1>About <small>Propcott</small></h1>

	<p>Social activism has been the optimal choice for counteracting wrongs that occur in society. Since its beginnings, social activism has manifested into various forms. One of which, is the widespread and commonly known method of boycotting. However, the practical application of boycotting has deviated from what boycotting truly is. As history progressed, somewhere along the way we lost sight of its essence. To boycott, is to combine in abstaining from, or preventing dealings with, a person, organization or even a country. Boycotting went from rallying in unison on Main Street, to merely declaring one’s discontent, and now, just hashtags. Without action, talk can only take us so far. That is where the problem lies. All of aforementioned have resulted in the diminishing of one of our greatest tools that contributed to the vast disconnect for collective action. In order to restore this effective tool to unify the masses in consolidated efforts, we must reinvent boycotts by retaining its fundamental actions and combining these actions with the technological resources presently available. Propcott is the reinvention of the boycotting.</p>

Whether it be researching, communicating, or socializing, technology has made it easy to engage in various activities. In recent years, we have seen the rise of technology used to start movements of ongoing social matters. The most successful of which, were able to amass a high volume of people. This phenomenon underscores that assembling the vast majority for a common purpose and action is imperative to spawn the societal change that we wish to see.
